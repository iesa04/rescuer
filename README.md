# Rescuer

Rescuer - The Fire Truck Configurator Project is a project that aims to simplify the design and customization process of fire trucks, catering to the specific requirements of firefighting organizations. This project introduces a user-friendly interface, enabling fire departments to configure and visualize their ideal fire trucks. The platform ensures optimal performance and functionality during emergency situations by allowing organizations to tailor various components such as electrical systems, chassis, engines, transmissions, aerial apparatus, and more as per their requirements.

The project encompasses a database structure with multiple interconnected tables to manage and store essential data related to the configuration details, costs, and specifications of various components. Each table corresponds to a specific category, such as electrical systems, chassis, engines, transmissions, suspensions, aerial apparatus, and more, facilitating efficient data organization and retrieval.

The Fire Truck Configurator Project serves as a pivotal tool for fire departments, enabling them to design and procure customized fire trucks tailored to their unique operational needs. Through the integration of database management, the project aims to streamline and optimize the process of acquiring specialized firefighting equipment, ultimately contributing to enhanced emergency response capabilities.


# Key Objectives:
Normalized Database Design: The database tables are designed so that they all satisfy 3NF (3rd Normal Form). The tables have been optimized so as to maintain both basic information about different fire truck components, and also the compatibility of each part. 

User-Friendly Interface: The configurator provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring that even non-technical users can easily navigate and make selections. 

Component Compatibility Checker: To ensure that the selected components and features work seamlessly together, the configurator includes a compatibility checker. This feature helps prevent issues related to integration and functionality, enhancing the overall reliability of the fire trucks.

Cost Estimation: The configurator provides real-time cost estimations based on the selected components, allowing fire departments to stay within budget constraints while still meeting their operational needs.

Modular Design Options: The configurator offers a modular design approach, allowing users to choose from a variety of predefined modules and components. his modular approach ensures flexibility and adaptability in designing fire trucks for diverse operational scenarios.
